title: Real Agile
---
Every time I've been involved with a company that has decided to move from waterfall-style development to an agile process there is always a point sooner or later that someone says "but that's not real agile".

By proclaiming a divergence from the "real agile" people normally mean that you are missing something out that the Scrum / DSDM etc book prescribes, usually the term is used to make a point, normally a negative one, about the process. But should you really be concerned that you are missing something out and does that preclude you from being "agile"?

Well firstly it's worth understanding the item(s) that people believe you haven't implemented properly, you could have missed something useful, but if with a clear understanding you choose to omit an element of the methodology then I believe you can still can claim to be agile.

With any change in process comes challenges and also opportunities to review the way you build software. Sometimes the actual act of getting everyone to think about processes yields benefits itself if only that people actually start to consider the wider process.
