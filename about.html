          <h2>About Me</h2>
		  <p>I'm Tom Cole, a software developer living in Milton Keynes in the UK.</p>
		  <p>My interest in computing started early and I hacked around with an old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL">Sinclair QL</a> before getting my first PC. I started programming in QBasic and later Visual Basic before heading off to study Software Engineering at <a href="http://www.shu.ac.uk/">Sheffield Hallam University</a>.</p>
		  <p>Despite focusing on C++ and Java at university, on graduating I fell into a short contract role developing a equine website in C# and ASP.Net for the now defunct CleeSaddlery.co.uk. Since then I have focused primarily on web development (with the odd console app and windows service thrown in) and particularly on Microsoft technologies.</p>		  
		  <p>These days I'm most comfortable writing code in C# and Javascript and tend to use MVC for most web projects I work on. Recently I've been using Coffeescript quite heavily.</p>
		  
		  <h2>About This Blog</h2>
		  <p>The intention of this blog is as an outlet for my ponderings on software and the software development process. As a result the opinions and statements are my own and not representative of my employer.</p>
		  <p>I've had a few attempts at posting regularly to this blog but have often lapsed, I resolve to try harder in the future.</p>
		  <p>The blog itself is hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, using <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.</p>
